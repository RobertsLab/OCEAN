**Â¡DiviÃ©rtete explorando el ocÃ©ano!**

The OCEAN Genome Browser is an interactive platform for visualizing and
exploring the genomes of marine organisms. Designed to support research,
education, and discovery, the browser brings together genomic resources
from diverse ocean life---from corals and mollusks to fish and
crustaceans.

Whether you're investigating genes linked to environmental resilience,
studying evolutionary adaptations, or simply curious about the hidden
molecular stories of the sea, the OCEAN platform offers open access to
curated, high-quality genomic datasets.

Goals â€¢ Enable Discovery: Provide a user-friendly interface to explore
gene structure, annotations, and functional data. â€¢ Support
Collaboration: Share data across research teams and institutions working
on ocean biodiversity, climate resilience, and conservation. â€¢ Promote
Open Science: Encourage transparent, accessible, and reproducible use of
genomic data for the broader scientific community.
